# CivicForge MVP - Authentication Implementation Handoff
*Completed: May 24, 2025*

## üéâ What Was Accomplished

Successfully implemented **basic authentication system** for the CivicForge Board MVP, addressing the #1 priority from the technical plan. The system is now secured and ready for production preparation.

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `email` and `password_hash` fields to users table via migration
- Migration script updated to handle these new fields
- Existing database structure preserved with backward compatibility

### 2. Authentication Module (`src/board_mvp/auth.py`)
- Password hashing using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with salt
- Simple JWT implementation for tokens (24-hour expiry)
- Functions: `hash_password()`, `verify_password()`, `create_token()`, `verify_token()`
- **IMPORTANT**: Secret key is hardcoded - MUST be moved to environment variable for production

### 3. API Updates (`src/board_mvp/api.py`)
- New endpoints:
  - `POST /auth/register` - User registration with email/password
  - `POST /auth/login` - Returns JWT token
  - `GET /me` - Get current authenticated user
- Protected endpoints now require Bearer token:
  - Quest creation (`POST /quests`)
  - Quest claiming (`POST /quests/{id}/claim`)
  - Work submission (`POST /quests/{id}/submit`)
  - Quest verification (`POST /quests/{id}/verify`)
  - Quest boosting (`POST /quests/{id}/boost`)
- Removed user ID parameters - actions now use authenticated user

### 4. Web UI Overhaul (`src/board_mvp/web.py`)
- Complete rewrite with authentication flow
- Login/Register forms with proper error handling
- Cookie-based session management (httponly flag for security)
- Protected pages redirect to login when not authenticated
- Shows current user and XP balance
- Logout functionality clears session

### 5. Seed Script Updates (`src/board_mvp/seed_tasks.py`)
- Now uses authentication API to create users
- Creates users with passwords
- Uses tokens to create quests
- Default test accounts:
  - Admin: `admin`/`admin123` (Organizer role, gets 20 XP)
  - Dev: `dev`/`dev123` (Participant role, 0 XP)

## üìã Testing Results

The implementation was thoroughly tested:
- ‚úÖ User registration with all required fields
- ‚úÖ Login/logout flow
- ‚úÖ Protected endpoints return 401 when not authenticated
- ‚úÖ Quest lifecycle works with different authenticated users
- ‚úÖ XP system properly tracks across users
- ‚úÖ Verification requires different user than performer

## üöÄ Next Steps for Production

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Move SECRET_KEY to environment variable
   - Add DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL
   - Configure allowed hosts

2. **Database Migration**
   - Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL
   - Set up connection pooling
   - Add database backups

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add HTTPS/SSL certificates
   - Configure CORS for API access
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement CSRF protection

4. **Additional Auth Features**
   - Email verification on registration
   - Forgot password flow
   - Password strength requirements
   - Account lockout after failed attempts

5. **Deployment**
   - Set up AWS infrastructure (suggested: ECS + RDS)
   - Configure load balancer
   - Set up monitoring (CloudWatch)
   - Add error tracking (Sentry)

## üõ† Required Dependencies

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Audit Findings (Semgrep, May 2025)

---

A comprehensive Semgrep OSS scan was performed on all code and configuration files (excluding markdown and documentation). The following findings require attention before production release:

### 1. src/board_mvp/migrations.py
- **Issue:** Use of formatted SQL queries with f-strings: `cur.execute(f"PRAGMA table_info({table})")`
- **Risk:** If the `table` variable is untrusted, this could allow SQL injection.
- **Recommendation:** Use parameterized queries or validate `table` against an allowlist of expected table names.

### 2. src/board_mvp/web.py
- **Issue:** Multiple instances where user input could be passed to `requests.post` for endpoints like `/claim_quest`, `/submit_work`, `/verify_quest`, and `/boost_quest`.
- **Risk:** If any user-controlled data is used to construct the request URL or payload, this could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Recommendation:** Ensure all user input used in these requests is strictly validated against an allowlist of allowed values, and never forward arbitrary responses to the user.

**No privacy leaks, secret exposures, or critical security issues were found in other code or configuration files.**

## üèÉ Running the System

```bash
# Set database path
export BOARD_DB_PATH=/path/to/civicforge/board.db

# Run migrations
python -m src.board_mvp.migrations

# Start server
uvicorn src.board_mvp.web:app --reload

# Seed data (in another terminal)
python -m src.board_mvp.seed_tasks
```

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Deprecation Warnings**: datetime.utcnow() warnings are non-critical but should be addressed
2. **Threading**: SQLite threading issues were resolved with thread-local connections
3. **Token Format**: Simple JWT implementation - consider PyJWT for production
4. **Form Handling**: Requires python-multipart package

## üîç Current System State

- **Database**: SQLite with auth fields added
- **Users**: 3 users created (admin, dev, + 1 user created during testing)
- **Quests**: 5 quests in various states
- **XP Distribution**: Admin has earned XP from verifications
- **Server**: Currently running on localhost:8000

The authentication system is fully functional and the MVP is ready for production preparation!
