# CivicForge: Rules, Norms, and Governance

## Our Vision: An Accountable, Action-Oriented Community

Welcome to a new kind of online platform driven by real identities, meaningful action, and effective collaboration. We envision a community where verified members work together on a task-board of real-world projects, combining the best of high-quality discourse and gamified teamwork. Our mission is to motivate positive-sum growth – everyone’s contributions create wins for the whole community – while avoiding the pitfalls that plagued earlier social platforms. This document lays out our core rules, norms, ethics, and governance structures. It’s not just a list of policies, but a values-forward manifesto for resilient, inclusive, and effective online engagement.

## Why a New Approach?

Traditional forums and social networks often optimized for clicks and outrage, overlooking community health. We learned from the failures of the past: the anonymity anarchy of early forums, the neglected moderation of mid-2000s platforms, and the engagement-at-all-costs ethos of big social media. Instead, we’re building with accountability and purpose from day one. Every design choice – from real-name accounts to task-based “quests” – serves our core goal: turning constructive conversation into coordinated action, while ensuring everyone feels safe and heard.

## Guiding Philosophy: Progress with Conservation

We embrace innovation in how people connect and cooperate, but cherish timeless principles of human decency and liberty. We champion open but responsible free speech, healthy disagreement, and emotional safety. Our default tone is positive and constructive, yet we leave space for critique and dissent – negativity is not banned, only channeled productively. We wield radical candor but with compassion and framed by curiosity and learning.

By setting positive defaults (like encouraging praise and solution-oriented feedback) while welcoming respectful criticism, we create an environment that wins hearts and minds without silencing voices. We never lose sight of functionality and core values in pursuit of growth; in other words, we won’t chase vanity metrics at the expense of our mission.

## Core Values & Principles

Our community is built on foundational values that guide every interaction and decision:

- **Authenticity and Accountability:** Every member is verified as a real individual. By standing behind our real names and identities, we foster trust and civility. This isn’t about surveillance; it’s about owning what we say and forging genuine connections.
- **Respectful Pluralism:** We celebrate diversity of perspective. Disagreement and debate are welcome – so long as it’s done with respect. Critique ideas, not people. No harassment, ad hominem attacks, or hate speech are tolerated.
- **Mutual Grace & Resilience:** Both speaker and listener share responsibility: strive not to offend and not to take offense too quickly. We extend good-faith assumptions, forgive honest mistakes, and coach newcomers rather than shame them.
- **Healthy Dialogue & Emotional Safety:** Our communication culture prioritizes curiosity, empathy, and “good faith” interpretation. We protect against abuse without cultivating a fragile “victim mindset.” Debate focuses on content, not personal digs.
- **Positive-Sum Collaboration:** We reject zero-sum thinking. Our platform is designed so that one member’s success helps others succeed too. We emphasize cooperation over competition, and celebrate group achievements.
- **Transparency and Trust:** Secrecy and ambiguity erode communities. We strive to be transparent about our policies, decisions, and how the platform operates. Governance rules are public, and moderation actions are logged and explained.
- **Growth and Adaptability:** No system is perfect – what matters is the ability to learn and adapt. We build robust, self-correcting mechanisms so the community can weather challenges and improve over time.

## Norms of Conduct: How We Communicate and Collaborate

To make these values concrete, here are the key norms every member agrees to follow:

### 1. Real Identity, Real Respect

Every user goes by their verified name or identity. With this accountability comes a responsibility to interact with basic courtesy. Personal attacks, doxxing, or defamation are strictly forbidden. Criticize ideas, but do not demean or threaten other members.

### 2. Assume Good Intent & Develop Thick-Skin

- **Speaker duties:** Speak clearly, avoid slurs or personal attacks, and be open to correction. If told your wording hurt, listen first; intent matters, but impact matters too.
- **Listener duties:** Pause before taking offense. Seek clarification before condemnation. Model resilience.

#### Grace Loop: curiosity → clarification → correction → growth.

No name-calling or slurs, no personal attacks, avoid sarcasm in serious discussions, ask rather than assume, and give private feedback when possible.

### 3. Protect, Empower & Coach

Zero tolerance for harassment, stalking, or threats. Members are encouraged to support those targeted, and moderators step in decisively where necessary. Mob dynamics (brigading, witch-hunts) are not tolerated; issues are handled through structured moderation and coaching, not public shaming.

### 4. Task-Oriented Mindset

Our platform centers on a task-board for taking action. Honor your commitments, communicate clearly, document your progress, and mentor newcomers. Celebrate achievements and recognize contributions.

### 5. Positive Defaults (With Room for Critique)

Start discussions and tasks with optimism and solution-orientation. Feedback should start positive before noting concerns. Dissent and frustration are welcome in dedicated spaces, as long as it’s done respectfully.

### 6. Quality Over Hype

- Cite sources or give evidence for factual claims.
- Write clearly and concisely without sacrificing nuance.
- No clickbait or misinformation.
- Share context with outside content.
- Stay on topic in focused threads.

We don’t optimize for addictive doom-scrolling; our goal is satisfaction and fulfillment.

## Task Board Mechanics & Gamified Engagement

- **Clear Task Design:** Concise descriptions, goals, deadlines, and responsibilities. Visibility creates accountability.
- **Dual-Attested Completion & Public Ledger** – a quest is only marked *Done* when both the actor **and** the recipient press “Confirm” in a transparent, open, and verifiable ledger  
- **Strive for ‘Perfect’; Satisfied with ‘Good’**: Each quest has at least two definitions of complete: **Done** (meets the brief) and **Exceptional** (goes above-and-beyond), preventing perfectionism from blocking progress while still celebrating excellence.
- **Gamified Incentives:** Experience points, badges, levels, and leaderboards – but co-op and group wins are the focus, not pure competition. Many contributions are recognized (mentorship, management, content creation).
- **Preventing Gamification Abuse:** Points and badges motivate, but are never the end-goal. We monitor for abuse and adjust incentives as needed.
- **Build → Measure → Delete** – experiments that fail the mission are sunset quickly and their lessons documented.  We bias for deletion over zombie features.
- **Explicit Product Metrics** – we publicly track *Verified Actions per Active User* and an abuse-rate ceiling.  Metrics guide; they never override values.
- **Advertising as Bridge Fuel** – ads are allowed but discouraged, viewed as a sometimes necessary means as a temporary path to ad-free self-sufficiency.
- **No Malicious-Compliance Loopholes** – protocol blocks insider capture, monopolies, or other bad-faith exploits; appeals run first at the World level, then at The Forge.
- **Cultural Norms from Gaming:** Approach tasks with good spirits, celebrate wins, communicate before rage-quitting, and mentor newcomers.
- **Mentorship and Leveling Up:** Newcomers onboard through tasks and learn from seasoned members. Advancement unlocks more responsibility, not just status.
- **Feedback and Iteration:** Learn from failures, share insights, and iterate on tasks and systems.

## CivicForge Architecture: *Worlds* & **The Forge**

CivicForge is a two-layer ecosystem:

* **World** – a self-contained task board instance tailored to a specific community or mission.  
  Every World can theme its UI, set local policies, incentives, culture, and govern itself within the constitutional rails.
* **The Forge** – the shared meta-framework that links all Worlds’ task boards.  
  The Forge handles cross-World federation, coordination, collaboration, standards governance, arbitration of edge-cases, and even friendly leaderboard-style competition so that lessons learned in one World compound for all.

Together these layers let us innovate rapidly at the edge while safeguarding interoperability, portability, and a common civic DNA.

## Privacy, Security & Anti-Surveillance Commitments

* **Right to be Forgotten** – any member can trigger an irreversible purge of their data in a timely manner; only anonymised aggregates remain.  
* **Least-PII Principle** – Worlds store only the minimum needed for auth (hash + display-name by default).  
* **End-to-End Roadmap** – private content should stay private while efforts are made to proof workflows for abuse detection that do **not** weaken cryptography.  
* **Quarterly Red-Team Audits** – independent privacy, bias, and security reviews are published every quarter.  
* **Anti-Surveillance Guard-Rails** – reputation scores are tied solely to completed actions, never to personal attributes; participation is voluntary; no data is correlated with external tracking systems.  
* **Externalities Considered, Not Fetishised** – we assess environmental and community impact and require mitigation plans, but will not let bureaucracy stall meaningful progress.

## User-Experience Mandate — “Positivity from Click One”

| Directive | Guard-Rail |
|-----------|------------|
| **AI Guide** instantly turns a plain-language need into a quest, auto-splitting sub-tasks by learning from past community patterns. | Override or edit in two taps; no hostage flows. |
| **Quick Wow** – land, quest, engage in < 90 s. | We time every flow and shave steps until it effective. |
| **Zero-Instruction UI** – must pass the “newbie test”; clear icons + plain labels explain themselves. | Visual / haptic response < 100 ms; no wall-of-text tutorials. |
| **Mobile- & Accessibility-First** – easily-reachable, extensible, low-bandwidth tolerant. | Reasonable accessiblity issues fixed before launch; real-world testers sign off. |
| **Human-Tone Copy** – verbs, not jargon. | Copy review is part of every PR; text slop rejected--own your work. |
| **World-Level Themes** – each World owns its look within Forge-standardised protocols and safety rails. | Core UX remains recognizable/referencable so users can roam between Worlds without friction. |

## Moderation, Self-Healing, and Adaptation

- **Multi-Tier Moderation:** Members flag issues, moderators enforce rules, a Council or admins handle major disputes and policy changes.
- **Guidelines and Training:** Moderators are trained to educate first, escalate only when necessary. Grace flags allow members to ask for coaching over sanctions.
- **Transparency and Appeals:** Moderation actions are explained and appealable. The appeals process is accessible and fair.
- **Self-Healing Mechanisms:** Regular community feedback and data monitoring help identify issues early. Peer correction is encouraged.
- **Red Teaming and Stress-Testing:** The Council or red teams test systems for weaknesses, and findings are used to improve processes.
- **Evolution of Rules:** The rules are living and can be amended through a clear process, but major shifts are carefully deliberated.

---

## Governance Structure & Roles

- **Community Council (Elected Governance):** Members elect a council to represent users and deliberate on high-level matters, with regular meetings and periodic elections. Major issues can go to a community referendum.
- **Moderators and Facilitators:** Moderators enforce rules and mediate disputes; facilitators guide projects and keep collaboration smooth.
- **Administrators (Platform Stewards):** Admins handle technical and legal matters, generally deferring to community governance but able to act in emergencies.
- **Constitution / Charter:** A living document enumerating values and rules. Amended through a transparent, participatory process.
- **Checks and Balances:** Power is distributed and accountable at each level; major changes are incremental and consensus-driven.
- **Minimal Necessary Rules:** Rules are only imposed where essential. Creativity and freedom are prioritized; critical issues (e.g. harassment) are enforced firmly.
- **Open Governance and Iteration:** Members are encouraged to suggest improvements, and failed experiments are rolled back.
