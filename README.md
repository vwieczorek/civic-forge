# Building a Better Online Community: Rules, Norms, and Governance

## Our Vision: An Accountable, Action-Oriented Community

Welcome to a new kind of online platform driven by real identities, meaningful action, and effective collaboration. We envision a community where verified members work together on a task-board of real-world projects, combining the best of high-quality discourse and gamified teamwork. Our mission is to motivate positive-sum growth – everyone’s contributions create wins for the whole community – while avoiding the pitfalls that plagued earlier social platforms. This document lays out our core rules, norms, ethics, and governance structures. It’s not just a list of policies, but a values-forward manifesto for resilient, inclusive, and effective online engagement.

## Why a New Approach?

Traditional forums and social networks often optimized for clicks and outrage, overlooking community health. We learned from the failures of the past: the anonymity anarchy of early forums, the neglected moderation of other platforms, and the engagement-at-all-costs ethos of big social media. Instead, we’re building with accountability and purpose from day one. Every design choice – from real-name accounts to task-based “quests” – serves our core goal: turning constructive conversation into coordinated action, while ensuring everyone feels safe and heard.

## Guiding Philosophy: Progress with Conservation

We embrace innovation in how people connect and cooperate, but cherish timeless principles of human decency and liberty. We champion open but responsible free speech, healthy disagreement, and emotional safety. Our default tone is positive and constructive, yet we leave space for critique and dissent – negativity is not banned, only channeled productively. We wield radical candor but with compassion and framed by curiosity and learning.

By setting positive defaults (like encouraging praise and solution-oriented feedback) while welcoming respectful criticism, we create an environment that wins hearts and minds without silencing voices. We never lose sight of functionality and core values in pursuit of growth; in other words, we won’t chase vanity metrics at the expense of our mission. We value first-principles thinking.

## Core Values & Principles

Our community is built on foundational values that guide every interaction and decision:

- **Authenticity and Accountability:** Every member is verified as a real individual. By standing behind our real names and identities, we foster trust and civility. This isn’t about surveillance; it’s about owning what we say and forging genuine connections.
- **Respectful Pluralism:** We celebrate diversity of perspective. Disagreement and debate are welcome – so long as it’s done with respect. Critique ideas, not people. No harassment, ad hominem attacks, or hate speech are tolerated.
- **Mutual Grace & Resilience:** Both speaker and listener share responsibility: strive not to offend and not to take offense too quickly. We extend good-faith assumptions, forgive honest mistakes, and coach newcomers rather than shame them.
- **Healthy Dialogue & Emotional Safety:** Our communication culture prioritizes curiosity, empathy, and “good faith” interpretation. We protect against abuse without cultivating a fragile “victim mindset.” Debate focuses on content, not personal digs.
- **Positive-Sum Collaboration:** We reject zero-sum thinking. Our platform works so that one member’s success helps others succeed too. We emphasize cooperation over competition, and celebrate group achievements.
- **Transparency and Trust:** Secrecy and ambiguity erode communities. We strive to be transparent about our policies, decisions, and how the platform operates. Governance rules are public, and moderation actions are logged and explained.
- **Growth and Adaptability:** No system is perfect – what matters is the ability to learn and adapt. We aim to build robust, customizable, self-correcting mechanisms so the community can weather challenges and improve over time.

## Norms of Conduct: How We Communicate and Collaborate

To make these values concrete, here are the key norms every member agrees to follow:

### 1. Real Identity, Real Respect

Every user goes by their verified name or identity. With this accountability comes a responsibility to interact with basic courtesy. Personal attacks, doxxing, or defamation are strictly forbidden. Criticize ideas, but do not demean or threaten other members.

### 2. Assume Good Intent & Develop Thick-Skin

- **Speaker duties:** Speak clearly, avoid slurs or personal attacks, and be open to correction. If told your wording hurt, listen first; intent matters, but impact matters too.
- **Listener duties:** Pause before taking offense. Seek clarification before condemnation. Model resilience.

#### Grace Loop: curiosity → clarification → correction → growth.

No name-calling or slurs, no personal attacks, avoid sarcasm in serious discussions, askrather than assume, and give private feedback when possible.

### 3. Protect, Empower & Coach

Zero tolerance for harassment, stalking, or threats. Members are encouraged to support those targeted, and moderators step in decisively where necessary. Mob dynamics (brigading, witch-hunts) are not tolerated; issues are handled through structured moderation and coaching, not public shaming.

### 4. Task-Oriented Mindset

Our platform centers on a task-board for taking action. Honor your commitments, communicate clearly, document your progress, and mentor newcomers. Celebrate achievements and recognize contributions.

### 5. Positive Defaults (With Room for Critique)

Start discussions and tasks with optimism and solution-orientation. Feedback should start positive before noting concerns. Dissent and frustration are welcome as long as it’s done respectfully.

### 6. Quality Over Hype

- Cite sources or give evidence for factual claims.
- Write clearly and concisely without sacrificing nuance.
- No clickbait, lazy posts, or misinformation.
- Share context with outside content.
- Stay on topic in focused threads.

We don’t optimize for addictive doom-scrolling; our goal is satisfaction and fulfillment.

## Task Board Mechanics & Gamified Engagement

- **Clear Task Design:** Concise descriptions, goals, deadlines, and responsibilities. Visibility creates accountability.
- **Gamified Incentives:** Experience points, badges, levels, and leaderboards – but co-op and group wins are the focus, not pure competition. Many contributions are recognized (mentorship, management, content creation).
- **Preventing Gamification Abuse:** Points and badges motivate, but are never the end-goal. We monitor for abuse and adjust incentives as needed.
- **Cultural Norms from Gaming:** Approach tasks with good spirits, celebrate wins, communicate before rage-quitting, and mentor newcomers.
- **Mentorship and Leveling Up:** Newcomers onboard through tasks and learn from seasoned members. Advancement unlocks more responsibility, not just status.
- **Feedback and Iteration:** Learn from failures, share insights, and iterate on tasks and systems.

---

## Moderation, Self-Healing, and Adaptation

- **Multi-Tier Moderation:** Members flag issues, moderators enforce rules, a Council or admins handle major disputes and policy changes.
- **Guidelines and Training:** Moderators are trained to educate first, escalate only when necessary. Grace flags allow members to ask for coaching over sanctions.
- **Transparency and Appeals:** Moderation actions are explained and appealable. The appeals process is accessible and fair.
- **Self-Healing Mechanisms:** Regular community feedback and data monitoring help identify issues early. Peer correction is encouraged.
- **Red Teaming and Stress-Testing:** The Council or red teams test systems for weaknesses, and findings are used to improve processes.
- **Evolution of Rules:** The rules are living and can be amended through a clear process, but major shifts are carefully deliberated.

---

## Governance Structure & Roles

- **Community Council (Elected Governance):** Members elect a council to represent users and deliberate on high-level matters, with regular meetings and periodic elections. Major issues can go to a community referendum.
- **Moderators and Facilitators:** Moderators enforce rules and mediate disputes; facilitators guide projects and keep collaboration smooth.
- **Administrators (Platform Stewards):** Admins handle technical and legal matters, generally deferring to community governance but able to act in emergencies.
- **Constitution / Charter:** A living document enumerating values and rules. Amended through a transparent, participatory process.
- **Checks and Balances:** Power is distributed and accountable at each level; major changes are incremental and consensus-driven.
- **Minimal Necessary Rules:** Rules are only imposed where essential. Creativity and freedom are prioritized; critical issues (e.g. harassment) are enforced firmly.
- **Open Governance and Iteration:** Members are encouraged to suggest improvements, and failed experiments are rolled back.
